# LokiJS

## Overview

LokiJS is a document oriented client side database written in javascript.
Its purpose is to store JSON documents in a mongodb fashion and retrieve them with a similar mechanism.
LokiJS is meant to fit situations in which persisting the data is not necessary, or where data sets are not so large that it wouldn't be a problem loading the entire db from a server and synchronising at the end of the work session.
